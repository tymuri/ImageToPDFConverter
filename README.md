# ImageToPDFConverter

## Introduction
This Python tool automates the conversion of HEIC images to PDF format, streamlines the merging of multiple PDFs into a single document, and compresses the final file for easy uploading. Originally developed to help manage and streamline my son's weekly math homework submissions, this tool utilizes system commands and Python libraries to efficiently transform and manage image files, making them more accessible and easier to distribute.

## Inspiration Behind the Automation
Every Sunday, my son and I would sit down to tackle his math homework—a special routine we both cherished. The process involved capturing photos of his completed homework, transferring these photos to my computer, converting them to PDF, and uploading the final document to his school's website. As simple as it sounds, it was surprisingly time-consuming and ate into our valuable together time.

Driven by the desire to make the most of our Sundays, I wrote this Python program that could handle all these steps automatically. Now, all it takes is a few clicks: choose the homework folder, set a destination for the PDF, and press start. In minutes, what used to take hours is done, giving us back our leisurely afternoons.

## Why This Matters
This project is more than just a script; it's a quality-of-life upgrade. It’s proof that with the right skills, you can solve real-life challenges and make time for what truly matters. For me, it was about spending more quality time with my son, not managing files.

Through this GitHub repository, I share not only the code but also the journey of a father leveraging his coding skills to enhance his family life. It’s a showcase of my problem-solving abilities and my dedication to applying what I learn in my computer science courses to real-world problems.

## Project Goals
This tool serves as evidence of my proficiency in applying computer science principles to real-world problems. By automating a time-consuming task, I've improved our weekly routine, allowing us more quality time while also enhancing my technical skills. This repository showcases my ability to identify problems, design solutions, and implement software—a key skill set for a software developer.

## How It Works
The program simplifies the entire workflow into a few clicks:
- **Select the source folder** where the image files are stored.
- **Choose the destination folder** for the final PDF.
- **Name the final file** and hit the **start** button.

I hope this project inspires others to consider how they can use their coding skills to improve their daily lives and those around them. For fellow developers, feel free to explore the code and perhaps even adapt it for your automation needs.
