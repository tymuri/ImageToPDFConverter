# ImageToPDFConverter

## Introduction
Hey there! I'm a dad and a developer, and this little project of mine is all about making life a bit easier. My son and I have a Sunday ritual where we tackle his math homework together. It's a great bonding time, but the process of managing his homework submissions was eating into our quality time. So, I built this Python tool to help us out.

## The Problem We Faced
Every week, we'd take photos of his completed homework, transfer them to my computer, convert them to PDF, and then upload the final document to his school's website. Simple enough, right? But it was surprisingly time-consuming and cut into our precious Sunday afternoons.

## The Solution
Driven by the desire to make the most of our Sundays, I wrote this Python program. Now, all it takes is a few clicks: choose the homework folder, set a destination for the PDF, and press start. What used to take hours is now done in minutes, giving us back our leisurely afternoons.

## Why This Matters to Me
For me, this project is more than just a bunch of code. It's about making our Sundays more enjoyable. Instead of spending time fiddling with files, we get to relax and enjoy our day together. It's amazing how a little bit of coding can make such a big difference in our lives.

## Project Goals
I wanted to show that the skills I'm learning can make a real difference in everyday life. By automating a time-consuming task, I've made our weekly routine smoother and freed up more time for fun and relaxation. This project is a testament to my problem-solving abilities and my dedication to applying what I learn in my computer science courses to real-world problems.

## How It Works
The program simplifies the entire workflow into a few clicks:
1. Select the source folder where the image files are stored.
2. Choose the destination folder for the final PDF.
3. Name the final file and hit the start button.

## New Feature: PDF Merging
In the latest update, I've added a feature that merges all the converted PDFs into a single file. This further simplifies the process by producing one consolidated PDF document.

## Future Plans
I'm always looking to improve this tool. Here are the features I plan to add next:
- **Reduce Final Merged PDF File Size**: Implementing a feature to compress the final merged PDF to save storage space and make it easier to upload.
- **Add GUI**: Creating a graphical user interface to enhance the user experience and make the tool more user-friendly.
